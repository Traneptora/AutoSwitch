# Lines beginning with # are ignored

# General rule:
# All numbers can be specified as normal numbers,
# But could also be specified as hexadecimal numbers by adding 0x to the front
# or as binary numbers by adding 0b to the front. (e.g. 0b10001 = 0x11 = 17)

# Config version number:
# If this is not found or does not match the current number, AutoSwitch will replace your config with the default one.

# ===== HOW TO SPECIFY A BLOCK OR ITEM =====

# Use the block or item name
# For example, diamond_pickaxe
# To specify a specific damage value, then use a +
# For example, birch planks are planks+2
# For example, an unbroken gold axe is gold_axe+0

# For a more detailed description on how to specify blocks, see the bottom of the config file.

# To specify all blocks or all items use a single @ instead of the name

# To specify all similar blocks, material-wise, put a $ in front of the block name
# For example, $planks means every single block that's made out of a wooden material.
 
# To specify all similar blocks or items, behavior-wise, put an @ in front of the block or item name
# For example, @redstone_ore means both lit and unlit ore
# For example, @diamond_pickaxe means all pickaxes
# Careful with perfectly generic items or blocks with no special properties like diamonds or cobblestone
# @diamond means all items and @cobblestone means all blocks 

# If the above thing is too narrow, you can broaden the definition of similarity
# To specify a broader similarity put [N] in front of the block or item name where N is some number
# where bigger N means broader
# (note that @name is a synonym for [0]name)
# [0]log means all logs of the first type
# [1]log means all logs
# [2]log means all rotated pillars (like quartz pillars)
# [3]log means all blocks
# [0]diamond_pickaxe means all pickaxes
# [1]diamond_pickaxe means all tools
# [2]diamond_pickaxe means all items
# [0]dropper means all droppers
# [1]dropper means droppers and dispensers
# [2]dropper means all blocks that hold items
# [3]dropper means all 

# ========= SILK TOUCH =============

# TODO description

# Also, you can use T << block to skip the silk touch calculation.

# Note: No always takes priority over yes.

# This one tells AS to assume Silk Touch does not work on smooth stone.
T < stone 

# This one tells AS to assume Silk Touch does not work on gravel.
# This line is necessary because silk touch does actually work on gravel:
#     - Without Silk Touch, gravel drops flint 1/10 of the time
#     - With Silk Touch, gravel never drops flint and always drops itself 
T < gravel

# ========= FORTUNE =================

# TODO description

# Also, you can use use F << block to skip the fortune calculation.

# Note: No always takes priority over yes.

# This one tells AS that fortune works on crops
F > @wheat

# This one makes AS treat coal like a nonfortune block (remove the # to add)
# F < coal_ore

F << $log

# ========= STANDARD TOOLS ==========
# TODO desc

# Note: No always takes priority over yes.

H shears > vine
H shears > tallgrass
S @diamond_hoe > @wheat
S @diamond_shovel < farmland
D shears < !($vine|$tallgrass|$leaves)

# S @+0:~0b11-0 < @
